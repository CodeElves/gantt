### This is a fork from https://github.com/frappe/gantt
Added couple of features for personal needs. If you found it useful for your case - welcome ;)
### Install
```
npm install frappe-gantt-codeelves
```
or if you are using yarn
```
yarn add frappe-gantt-codeelves
```

### Added Features
1. Added new boolean option `is_bar_draggable`, so now you can specify if bar will be draggable. Default value: `true`;

2. Separated click event and popup handler. That means now when you set a `popup_trigger` option as 'mouseover', click handler will work independently.
